# Say It

Private, local text-to-speech for Apple silicon Macs. Say It turns selected or
copied text into speech with open models running through
[MLX Audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio)—your text and generated audio
stay on your Mac.

## Highlights

- **Speak from anywhere.** Select text in another app and press the configurable
  selection hotkey, choose **Services → Say It**, or use the separate clipboard
  hotkey.
- **A native menu-bar player.** Read the clipboard, pause, seek, change playback
  speed, follow the spoken text, and revisit history without leaving your
  current app.
- **Open models from Hugging Face.** Download supported MLX models in the app,
  including [Qwen3 TTS](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base-8bit),
  [Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Kokoro-82M-bf16),
  [Chatterbox](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Chatterbox-TTS-fp16), and
  [OmniVoice](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OmniVoice). Compatible
  community models can be added by Hugging Face repository ID.
- **Create voices.** Models expose the features they support, from built-in
  voices and voice descriptions to random voice discovery and voice cloning.
- **Efficient model loading.** Only one model is kept in memory, and it is
  automatically unloaded after a configurable period of inactivity (ten
  minutes by default).
- **Local by design.** Synthesis works offline after model download. There is no
  analytics, cloud inference, or passive clipboard monitoring.

## Clone your voice

For models with voice-cloning support, Voice Studio guides you through recording
or importing a clean reference sample, checks its quality, and saves it as a
reusable voice profile. You stay in control of the recording: voice samples and
profiles remain on your Mac, and cloning runs locally.

Only clone a voice when you have the speaker's permission.

## Getting started

Say It requires macOS 15 or later on an Apple silicon Mac.

1. Install and launch Say It.
2. Choose and download a model during onboarding.
3. Optionally allow Accessibility access, select text in another app, and press
   **Control–Option–S**. You can also copy text and press
   **Control–Option–V**, or choose **Services → Say It**.

Both shortcuts can be changed in Settings. Say It queries the current selection
or reads clipboard text only when you explicitly invoke the matching action.

### Terminal

The app includes a `sayit` CLI for speech, playback, models, voices, and
automation:

```sh
sayit "Read this aloud"
printf 'Read standard input' | sayit
sayit status
sayit pause
sayit resume
```

Run `sayit --help` to see all commands and options.

## Architecture

The native SwiftUI frontend is separate from a per-user backend service that
owns model downloads, synthesis, playback, and history. The app and CLI talk to
that service over XPC. A narrowly scoped accessibility helper retrieves the
frontmost app's selection only when requested. An optional, token-protected HTTP
server exposes the same synthesis engine to other local apps through a
versioned REST API bound to `127.0.0.1`. Advanced settings can instead point
synthesis at a user-configured OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint on another
machine; playback and history stay on the Mac, and local MLX remains the
default when that option is off.

The synthesis layer is built primarily on
[MLX Audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio), with the native Swift
integration provided by
[mlx-audio-swift](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio-swift).

## Build from source

Install Xcode with Swift 6.2 or later and
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), then run:

```sh
brew install xcodegen
./Scripts/build-app.sh
```

Local builds compile independent targets and Swift source batches in parallel,
using all available logical CPUs by default. Set `SAYIT_BUILD_JOBS` to cap the
number of concurrent build operations. Signed release builds keep whole-module
optimization; set `SAYIT_SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE=wholemodule` to reproduce that
behavior in an ad-hoc local build.

Local builds are written to `Build/DerivedData-Local`; signed builds use
`Build/DerivedData-Release`. The build stops if the app at its selected output
path is still running, so quit Say It before rebuilding it.

For a stable Accessibility grant across Debug rebuilds, set
`SAYIT_SELECTION_SIGN_IDENTITY` to the same Apple Development signing identity
used for the app. The build does not select a certificate from your keychain
automatically.

Tests run with `swift test --disable-sandbox`.
