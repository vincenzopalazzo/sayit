# Security and Privacy

Say It processes selected and copied text locally by default. It does not use
analytics, telemetry, passive clipboard or microphone monitoring, Apple Events,
or broad filesystem access. Cloud or remote inference happens only when you
explicitly enable Advanced remote OpenAI-compatible TTS and speak text; the API
key for that endpoint is stored in the Keychain. Its optional selection shortcut uses a
dedicated Accessibility helper only when the user explicitly configures access
or invokes that shortcut.

The app stores only cleaned plain text in history. Diagnostic events use stable
codes and allowlisted numeric or categorical metadata; source text, access
tokens, local paths, exported filenames, machine names, and account names are
not accepted by the diagnostic API.

Hugging Face tokens for gated models are stored in the macOS Keychain. Model
snapshots are pinned to an immutable revision and installed inside the
sandboxed App Group container.

The menu-bar app and bundled CLI communicate with the per-user speech agent over
XPC. The speech agent accepts only same-user clients signed with the app or CLI
bundle identifier, the private Say It client entitlement, and the same signing
team. The unsandboxed selection helper accepts only the same-user, same-team
Say It app with that client entitlement. It exposes only authorization status,
an authorization prompt, and an on-demand selected-text read; it does not
monitor selection changes. Service lifecycle and API-token administration are
never exposed over HTTP.

The optional HTTP API is disabled by default and binds only to `127.0.0.1`.
It validates the loopback Host header, has no permissive CORS policy, limits
request sizes and per-token request rates, and accepts authentication only as
`Authorization: Bearer …`. API secrets contain 256 random bits, are displayed
once, and are stored only as SHA-256 digests plus non-secret metadata in
Keychain. Submitted text and bearer tokens are excluded from normal logs.

Loopback HTTP is intended for local automation. A future network-accessible
mode would require HTTPS and certificate management; changing the bind address
is not supported.

Please report security issues privately to the repository owner rather than
opening a public issue with sensitive logs.
